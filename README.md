### The royalty-free photo delivery platform for free-forever use!

<br> <br>

**This is a non-commercial project which returns some images based on the user search input. Note that the app is currently in development mode, so stay tuned for the final release soon!**

<br>

• The app will allow users not only to search for photos, but also to "heart" them (internally, within the app) <br> <br>
• There will be possible to create & manage photo collections, where user can "save" and store images that he / she finds interesting. <br> <br>
• Photos - most likely - will be downloadable. <br> <br>
• User can view each individual image in detailed mode, which showcases the photo author, the photo provider with appropiate links and will give more detailed information about the image itself. <br> <br>
