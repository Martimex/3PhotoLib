# 3PhotoLib

### The royalty-free photo delivery platform for free-forever use!

<br> <br>

**NOTE#1: <br> <br> This is a non-commercial project which returns some images based on the user search input. Note that the app is currently in development mode, so stay tuned for the final release soon!**

<br>

**NOTE#2: <br> <br> The project is available as a pre-release version at: https://threephotolib.vercel.app/  Since most of the features are completed by now, the project is deployed in its current version, which will be updated regularly.**

<br>

**NOTE#3: <br> <br> In its' current state, the project is not responsive for large screens / desktops. The layout will be supporting larger devices soon. For now, if you want to preview the app in such devices, visit https://threephotolib.vercel.app/  and then press CTRL + SHIFT + I  and CTRL + SHIFT + M afterwards. That way you can emulate the project from mobile device perspective.**

### The purpose of an app

<br><br>

• 3PhotoLib is an online photo library, which allows you to view, save and download royalty-free images, whether for personal or commercial use. After setting up an account and successfully verifying it, you can search for photos of any kind through 3 of our Providers: Pixabay, Pexels and Unsplash.

<br>

• You can fully manage the photos - that is: liking/unliking them, creating a separate 'containers' (known as collections), moving or cloning photos from one collection to another, and much more!

<br>

• You can view each individual image in detailed mode, which showcases the photo author, the photo provider with appropiate links and will give more detailed information about the image itself.
